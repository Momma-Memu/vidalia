# vidalia
Vidalia is a random Dungeons and Dragons campaign and event generator. It's friendly to new players and gives people an opportunity to enjoy the game without the need of writing their own campaign. 


## How does this work?

* New users can create an array of characters, as many as they like, and choose from a single base plot point. From there, "events" are triggered. Each event has an amount of branching events that can occur after depending on your choices. 

* Not all events are choice based, in that situation, a random selected outcome is given on each playthrough, changing your experience on each playthrough of the base campaign.

* Players health and inventory are tracked, eliminating the need for manual tracking of your own. 

* Each base campaign will take place in the magical world of Vidalia, a Matriarchy ruled society by various queens and various islands. The beginnning island, Vidalia, is the place all base campaigns start from. 

* Each base campaign has a beginning year, meaning depending on the year you choose to play the campaign in, different rulers and different circumstances may take place. 

* Players can interract with NPC's (Non Playable Characters) through a selection of conversation topics which can alter the path of the campaign. 

* Players can attack with their choice of abilities and weapons, all of which will be determined FOR YOU, without the need for dice.
