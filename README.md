# Vidalia
Vidalia is a randomized encounter, combat simulator inspired by Dungeons and Dragons. This project was built with the intention of learning more about React and especially React Context. This project was originally created at a time when I was still learning how to use React. As such, I would not recommend using it as reference to understand React or any other packages I utilized.

## The Database:
The database currently supports spells, consumables, monsters, classes, weapons, and abilities. 


## How does this work?

* New users can create an array of character classes.

* Players will engage in combat with enemies that are proportional to the current "depth" of the dungeon they have reached.

* Initiative determines the turn order of the player and enemies. 

* Players can attack with their choice of abilities, consumables, and weapons, the result of which will be determined for you based on your character and your targets stats.

* Players can increase their character's stats after reaching the necessary amount of experience points.

* Clearing encounters will gradually increase the difficulty, and availability of more desirable item drops.
